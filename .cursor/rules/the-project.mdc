- Always strictly use English terms over American terms such as organisation instead of organisation

## Project Vision

I'd like to map out a "whole" organisation and the systems, documents, workflows, etc that it needs to function.

I want to create this organisation in a way that it focuses on the people and their needs and the systems and workflows are wrapped around them.

Currently people need to get extensive training to learn how systems and software work rather than the software and systems being intuitive and easy to use. I just want to create a playbook that sets out what an organisation needs. I dont want to do this in one step. I expect us to do this over a long period of time and hopefully in small steps.

The playbook will be presented in this SvelteKit app.

The playbook will develop over time and we'll update it in the playbook-rules.mdc

## Why This Matters: The Case for Human-Centered organisations

organisations today face unprecedented challenges in managing information, systems, and people. Our human-centered organisational playbook directly addresses these pain points to create more effective, efficient, and satisfying work environments.

## Current organisational Challenges

### Rising Information Complexity
* **Data explosion**: organisations now manage exponentially more data than even five years ago
* **Format proliferation**: Information exists in structured databases, documents, emails, chats, and specialized applications
* **Integration struggles**: Different systems often speak different languages, requiring complex and brittle integration solutions
* **Versioning nightmares**: Tracking the latest version of critical information becomes increasingly difficult

### Siloed Information Systems
* **Departmental barriers**: Information trapped in department-specific systems and applications
* **Historical legacy**: Decades of accumulated systems that don't communicate effectively
* **Vendor lock-in**: Proprietary technologies that resist integration and sharing
* **Knowledge hoarding**: Information treated as power rather than a shared organisational asset

### Staff Retention and Knowledge Loss
* **Institutional knowledge walks out the door**: When employees leave, critical operational knowledge often leaves with them
* **Training burden**: New staff require extensive training on complex, unintuitive systems
* **Frustration and burnout**: Staff experience "system fatigue" from navigating cumbersome tools
* **Generational expectations**: Newer workers expect intuitive digital experiences comparable to consumer applications

### Lack of Data Standardisation
* **Inconsistent formats**: The same information stored differently across systems
* **Terminology confusion**: Different terms used for the same concepts
* **Quality variations**: Inconsistent validation leading to unreliable data
* **Reporting difficulties**: Inability to generate meaningful insights from fragmented data

### Technology Acceleration
* **Constant upgrades**: Never-ending cycle of system updates and migrations
* **Security challenges**: Growing threats require sophisticated protection measures
* **Cloud transition**: Movement from on-premises to cloud-based systems
* **Automation pressure**: Need to automate routine tasks while maintaining human judgment

### Regulatory Compliance Burden
* **Growing requirements**: Increasing regulations around data privacy and security
* **Cross-jurisdiction complexity**: Different requirements across regions and countries
* **Audit readiness**: Need to demonstrate compliance through documentation and processes
* **User rights**: Requirements to provide access and control to individuals whose data is stored

### User Experience Failures
* **Systems designed for computers, not people**: Interfaces that follow system logic rather than human workflows
* **Training overhead**: Excessive time spent learning how to use poorly designed systems
* **Accessibility gaps**: Systems that exclude users with disabilities
* **Mobile limitations**: Legacy systems that don't work effectively on modern devices

## The Human-Centered Advantage

Our playbook offers a comprehensive approach to addressing these challenges by placing human needs at the center of organisational design:

### For Leaders
* Reduced operational costs through streamlined systems
* Improved decision-making with reliable, accessible information
* Enhanced organisational resilience through better knowledge management
* Higher staff retention by reducing system frustration

### For Staff
* More time spent on meaningful work rather than fighting with systems
* Reduced training requirements through intuitive design
* Greater workplace flexibility through location-independent access
* Improved job satisfaction through tools that support rather than hinder

### For IT Teams
* Simplified system landscape with fewer integration points
* Clearer information architecture that scales with organisational needs
* Reduced support burden from user-friendly systems
* More strategic role in enabling organisational success

### For Customers/Clients/Service Users
* Faster, more accurate service delivery
* Consistent experiences across all touchpoints
* Greater transparency into processes and decisions
* Higher quality outcomes from more effective organisations

By addressing these fundamental challenges with a human-centered approach, organisations can transform from struggling with complexity to thriving through clarity, creating workplaces where both people and technology perform at their best.
