# Coding workflow preferences

- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task.
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task.
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architectures of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed.
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes.
