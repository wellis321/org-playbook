                Traditional approaches to improvement tracking suffer from fundamental flaws:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-slate-600 mb-4">
                <li>KPIs scattered across departments with inconsistent definitions and formats</li>
                <li>Metrics locked in static reports and spreadsheets, making historical analysis difficult</li>
                <li>Disconnection between improvement metrics and the people they affect</li>
                <li>Rigid reporting formats that can't adapt to different stakeholder needs</li>
                <li>Data silos preventing cross-departmental insights and holistic improvements</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-slate-600">
                The Integrated Improvement Intelligence System (I³S) addresses these challenges by creating a unified, flexible approach to tracking, analysing, and acting on improvement opportunities across the entire organisation.
