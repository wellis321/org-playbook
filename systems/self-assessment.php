            <p class="mb-4 text-slate-600">
                In Scotland, all social care providers are regulated and monitored by the Care Inspectorate. Rather than waiting for periodic external inspections, organisations should continuously self-assess to ensure they meet established standards and requirements.

                Our Self-Assessment Management System provides the digital tools needed to implement a proactive approach to quality assurance and regulatory compliance, transforming assessment from a reactive exercise to an ongoing process of improvement.
